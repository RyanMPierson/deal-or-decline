## Sound Controls:

The game includes two sound control buttons:
- **ðŸŽµ** - Toggle background music on/off
- **ðŸ”Š** - Toggle sound effects on/off

## Where to Find Sounds:

You can find free game sounds at:
- **Freesound.org** (requires free account)
- **Zapsplat.com** (requires free account)
- **OpenGameArt.org**
- **BBC Sound Effects Library**

Or create your own using:
- **Audacity** (free audio editor)
- **Online tone generators** for simple beeps/chimes

## File Format Notes:

- Both MP3 and WAV formats are supported
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 1MB each for sound effects)
- Background music can be larger but should still be web-optimized
- Make sure sounds are normalized to prevent volume spikes

## Technical Notes:

- The game automatically detects if audio files are available and properly loaded
- If audio files fail to play (due to browser policies or missing files), synthesized fallback sounds are used
- Sound overlap prevention ensures only one instance of each sound plays at a time
- The system gracefully handles browser autoplay restrictions

The game will work without these files, but adding them will greatly enhance the player experience!
